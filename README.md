# Martingale experiment
a quick simulation of how martingale betting would work in the real work. Code can be found in `Martingale.ipynb`. tldr: if you have a finite amount of money (even if it's a lot) you are not expected to gain/lose money using a martingale betting system on a 50/50 coin toss (simulation even ignores betting limits which are common)
